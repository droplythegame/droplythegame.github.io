                            <p>Do you find yourself in stressful situations, at work, studying, or just simply waiting for your spouse, kids, friends, or date?
                                <br><br>
                                Droply is a game designed with one goal in mind: freedom. Free of stress, free of thoughts, free of distractions, you can enjoy it anywhere, anytime, from the comfort of your small companion: your phone.
                                <br><br>
                                
                                Hi there! Our names are Jason and Jad. We are the originators of Droply The Game. We created Droply in hopes that it brings you the same peace of mind that it did for us. We developed it as a remedy for ourselves and after optimizing it to offer the smoothest experience possible, we deemed it worthy enough to benefit you as it has us.
                                <br><br>
                                
                                As best friends since childhood, working in different industries, we came to a common consensus that we both needed a minimalistic game to help us rest our minds and rejuvenate our thoughts. A low-intensity, non-mission-based game that would not require any focus or commitment was the answer; a game so beautifully designed, birthed from the essence of minimalism that will help your thoughts fade away into sheer reflex. 
                                <br><br>
                                
                                You can freely enjoy Droply, with no game based in-app purchases other than the in-game currency. If you wish to become part of our forever fast-growing community, and support us while simultaneously benefitting from great content, offers, and value in-game and real-life, we invite you to keep up to date with our upcoming Community Support Page.

                            <h4>1. What is Droply and how does it work?</h4>
                            <p>Droply is a web-based 2D game aimed at helping you relax and clear your mind whenever you feel like you want to rest a bit. The concept is fairly simple: you have a water droplet character (in that case Droply at first) that is falling from the sky endlessly. All you have to do is dodge the obstacles by swiping on your screen left and right. In the process, you can protect yourself with a timed shield, as well as gather in-game currency (coins) that will offer you the possibility of unlocking new characters and landscapes (backgrounds).</p>

                            <h4>2. Where can I find Droply and play it?</h4>
                            <p>You can play it simply by opening up the link: <a href='https://droplythegame.com'>https://droplythegame.com/</a>, and bookmarking it on your phone as an independent web-page on your homescreen for quick access.</p>

                            <h4>3. What are hearts?</h4>
                            <p>Hearts are a way of letting you know how many tries you have left, giving you the possibility of continuing the game without restarting everything and potentially losing your progress. Whenever you have less than 3 hearts, you can very easily buy some more in our in-game shop. That way you never run out of progress!</p>

                            <h4>4. Continue game & restart game?</h4>
                            <p>Continue game and restart game are essentially the same thing except for some key differences:
                                <br><br>- ‚ÄúContinue game‚Äù gives you the possibility, as the name suggests, to continue your progress in-game in exchange for a life (heart). You have a maximum of 3 hearts, and whenever you lose one, you can buy a new one instead in the in-game shop.
                                <br><br>- ‚ÄúRestart game‚Äù occurs when you don‚Äôt have any lives left, and you haven‚Äôt refilled your heart count. Once you choose to ‚ÄúRestart game‚Äù, you completely restart from scratch, only losing your gathered coins so far, but the hearts get filled again. Don‚Äôt forget to restock on hearts! And good luck!
                                </p>

                            <h4>5. Why can I only play Droply on a web browser and not an app?</h4>
                            <p>Great question! The reason we opted for a web-based game instead of an app, is simply to offer 
                                a universally seamless experience across all platforms: desktop, tablet or phones, without any compromise on efficiency and performance. All the while benefiting from a download-free experience, saving up storage and data, without the need to go through recurrent updates stored in your hardware‚Äôs memory.
                                <br><br>While we are offering you an exclusive taste of what Droply will be, we‚Äôre in the process of building the full implementation of the app as well as a Community Support page to stay up to date, learn more about it, and have your input potentially used in the full game.

                            <h4>6. How is my progress stored if the game is not linked to my account?</h4>
                            <p>Thanks to numerous approaches on storage technology, we deemed most beneficial the use of local data storage through your browser with a login-less game approach.</p>

                            <p>No. We do not gather any information, it is built with security and privacy in mind. The only information we have access to is un-identifiable data not related to your personal information. The data in question is related to the website analytics for our own metrics monitoring: such as number of views, users and number of clicks.</p>

Just keep in mind that once you clear your data, you will not be able to retrieve it anymore.</p>

                            <p>Awesome question! Once you become a member through Buy Me A Coffee, you will be able to provide us your unique ID directly linked only to your device, that you can find in the settings section of the game. Once we receive your Unique ID, the prizes will be automatically implemented to your game. </p>
